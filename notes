Create a web app with React that allows for users to generate and download memes using the https://memegen.link/ website.

1.  [] access memes from URL
    index.js file:
    --> same or different way between node and react?
    --> would it even work to work with node and react? 
          - node: pnpm init
          - react: pnpm start

- get function
  [] generate img URL
- cheerio: generate links
  [] download memes
- donwload: library or function or code?

Connection between index.js and App.js:
a) index.js
b) create variables that can be embedded in component.js and finally in App.js
create a template / a component with the following dynamic components:

- component 1: generated and downloaded meme =
- component 2: top field
- component 3: bottom field
  c) preview

2.  [ ] Enter text for the top and bottom of the meme

- input fields?
  [ ] The top text box needs to have a label element associated with it containing the text `Top text`
- upper field with label and with speific text
  [ ] The bottom text box needs to have a label element associated with it with the text `Bottom text`
- lower field with label and specific text
  [ ] Both text boxes should be empty when the page first loads
- different values --> useState - initial value = empty - new value = entered value
  [ ] Preview the generated meme

3.  [ ] The image element needs to have an html attribute set as follows: `data-test-id="meme-image"` - [ ] This image element should show a working image when the page first loads

- [ ] Change the meme template (the background image)
  - [ ] The meme template selector element needs to have a label element associated with it containing the text `Meme template`
  - [ ] If the user follows the steps below, the `doge` meme template needs to be selected:
    1. Click on the label of the meme template selector
    2. Clear any existing value (eg. with a text box)
    3. Type the text `doge`
    4. Hit enter
- [ ] Download the meme by clicking on a button
  - [ ] The button element needs to contain the text `Download`
