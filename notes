Create a web app with React that allows for users to generate and download memes using the https://memegen.link/ website.

It should allow the user to:

- [ ] Enter text for the top and bottom of the meme
      2x input field

  - [ ] The top text box needs to have a label element associated with it containing the text `Top text`
  - [ ] The bottom text box needs to have a label element associated with it with the text `Bottom text`
  - [ ] Both text boxes should be empty when the page first loads
        meaning different states --> useState with initial and current value, updater function

  ***

- [ ] Preview the generated meme
  - [ ] The image element needs to have an html attribute set as follows: `data-test-id="meme-image"`
    - [ ] This image element should show a working image when the page first loads
- [ ] Change the meme template (the background image)
  - [ ] The meme template selector element needs to have a label element associated with it containing the text `Meme template`
  - [ ] If the user follows the steps below, the `doge` meme template needs to be selected:
    1. Click on the label of the meme template selector
    2. Clear any existing value (eg. with a text box)
    3. Type the text `doge`
    4. Hit enter
- [ ] Download the meme by clicking on a button
  - [ ] The button element needs to contain the text `Download`

## Stretch goals:

- [ ] Reduce the amount of times a meme image is generated (don't generate it every time a user presses a key). Instead, generate a new image when the user clicks a button
  - [ ] The button element needs to have an html attribute set as follows: `data-test-id="generate-meme"`
- [ ] Use a `#`, `?` and `/` in your meme text
- [ ] Save a history of generated meme top text, bottom text, and meme photo type. This history should reappear on refresh of the application.
- [ ] Make your application work offline (without a network connection) with the [PWA capabilities built in to `create-react-app`](https://create-react-app.dev/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app/). Any meme images that were generated while online in the application should be available to be generated again offline as well.
- [ ] Create a favicon that identifies your app: (see [Generating and Adding Favicons](https://learn.upleveled.io/courses/bootcamp-pern/modules/cheatsheet-design-ux/#generating-and-adding-favicons))
